# My R Programming Practice

Welcome to my R Programming Practice repository! This repository is where I upload my R code as I practice and learn more about the R programming language. It serves as a personal space for me to track my progress, experiment with different concepts, and showcase my projects.

## About Me

I'm Vivek, a passionate learner interested in data science, analytics, and programming. R is one of the languages I'm focusing on, and this repository is a reflection of my journey as I improve my skills and tackle new challenges.

## Getting Started
